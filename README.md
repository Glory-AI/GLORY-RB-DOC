## 1. MOTION SENSING LED SYSTEM
This system is designed using a microcontroller(Arduino) which is the brain, a PIR(Passive Infrared) sensor, a resistor and a LED (Light Emitting Diode)
It works by sensing motion and once sensed, light comes on. Once the send=sor does not detect any motion, the LED comes off.
The motion-sensing LED system , enhances convenience by providing light on demand,provides increased security by deterring intruders and alerting occupants, and offers energy savings by only illuminating areas when needed.

## 2. PLANT MONITOR
This system works by sensing the level of moisture in a plant and sending a buzzer once a particular threshold is exceeded(200 CENTIBARS)
