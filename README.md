# GLORY-ROBOTICSBOOTCAMP-DOCUMENTATION
This repository contains the projects undertaken at RAIN-INN OAU Robotics Workshop

CONCEPTS DISCUSSED:

* Robotics: The  designing, building, and using robots, which are machines programmed to perform tasks automatically or with human guidance. It involves input, processing and output.
* Sensors and Actuators: A sensor is a device that detects changes in the environment (like light, heat, distance, sound, or pressure) and converts them into computer-understandable signals. An actuator is a device that converts energy, such as electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic, into mechanical motion to control asystem.
* Arduino ATMega238P: THis is a type of microntroller thta acts as the brain of or communication interface among other electronic components.
* DIsplay Modules: Display modules are self-contained units designed to show text and images by integrating a display panel with essential components like a backlight, driver circuitry, and an interface for communication.
* Virtual tools: These are platforms that serve as simulation interfaces for building electronic projects before real life connections.

## 1. BLINKING AN LED
This project uses a Light Emitting Diode(LED) , a breadboard and a microcontroller. The microcontroller is programmed such that LED blinks (i.e goes on and off at certain intervals).

## 2. MOTION SENSING LED SYSTEM
This system is designed using a microcontroller(Arduino) which is the brain, a PIR(Passive Infrared) sensor, a resistor and a LED (Light Emitting Diode)
It works by sensing motion and once sensed, light comes on. Once the send=sor does not detect any motion, the LED comes off.
The motion-sensing LED system , enhances convenience by providing light on demand,provides increased security by deterring intruders and alerting occupants, and offers energy savings by only illuminating areas when needed.

## 3. PLANT MONITOR
This system is designed using a soil moisture sensor, a breadboard, a buzzer, an LED and a microcontroller.
It works by sensing the level of moisture in a plant and sending a signal to the buzzer to make a sound and led to come on once a particular threshold is exceeded(200 CENTIBARS).

## 4. SMART DUSTBIN
This system is designed using an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, abreadboard(for commmon connections) and a microcontroller(Arduino)
It works by using the ultrasonic sensor to detect an object at a particular distance(50cm) that wants to be thrown into a dustbin. Once the approaching object is detected 50 cm or less, the dustbin opens automatically by the means of the servo motor and receives the dirt to be thrown into it.

## 5. LCD SCRRENWRITER
This project is focused on printing charcters on an LCD(Liquid Crystal Display) to make it visible and readable. The size used in this project is the 16x2 LCD i.e 2 rows , 16 columns.
The image below is the display of 2 sentences occupying the 2 rows of the display.

## 6. OLED SECREENWRITER

OLED(Organic Light Emitting Diode) is a display module and a high contrast image producing one.
This project is focused on printing a moving and changing characters display. It prints a set of charcter with moving diagonal display too.

## 7. JOYSTIC CONTROLED SERVO MOTOR
This project uses a joystic, 2 servo motors, a breadboard and a microcontroller.
How it works: The first servo motor is controlled by the vertical(or y-axis) movement of the joystick; the second servo motor is controlled by the horizontal movement of the joystick.
